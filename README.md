Low Birth Weight is the label given to babies with weights below 2.5 Kg Low Birth Weight (LBW) has been identified as one of the major public health problems worldwide. Birth weight has a strong relationship with infant deaths, and the death rate of LBW children is much higher compared to that of Normal Birth Weight (NBW) children. When we speak of Low Birth Weight, we mean infants weighing less than 2.5 kg at birth. It is quite a serious public health problem in the entire globe. The birth weight of the infant and the probability of whether or not they survive are actually closely connected; that is, Low Birth Weight infants have such higher likelihood of mortality compared to infants with Normal Birth Weight. It's why it's so crucial to know whether or not a baby is truly going to be low birth weight it can guide efforts to minimize these harmful effects on our kids. This's not a small issue; this's an issue of enormous proportions in the world and results in serious illness in the short and long term. We are referring to complications such as developmental disorders, neurodevelopmental outcomes, and even severe health disorders such as diabetes, stroke, hypertension, and other conditions that LBW infants may have. Figures also indicate that among 22 million deliveries, roughly 16% of the infants are struggling with low birth weight complications globally. Things are particularly critical in developing nations, and India alone is responsible for a staggering 30% of all the cases of LBW globally. To put that into perspective, the average baby is 8 pounds at birth, so a low-birth-weight baby may be a perfectly healthy child who just happens to be significantly smaller. But they do have some actual health issues as well. The most critical input factors are the mother's age, height, weight, gestational days, plurality (single or multiple), and whether she smokes. All these characteristics have significant influences on fetal growth, and by including them in predictive modeling, the model is improved. Preprocessing methods such as feature scaling, handling missing values, and data balancing are also utilized for improvement of model performance. Data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and testing are the processes involved. The historical birth records are utilized as training data, and test metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared scores are utilized to check the predictive power of the model. To make sure that the model is strong enough, methods like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are utilized. The model that is thus derived is then implemented as a web application, with health indicators pertinent where possible inputted by the healthcare professionals and expectant women, who receive real-time risk prediction of LBW. User-friendliness of the web application enables ready and easy use for non-technical users. With the inclusion of machine learning in prenatal care, the process will improve the early identification of high-risk pregnancies, start early medical intervention, and eventually reduce the incidence of low birth weight for the babies. Future development can entail the inclusion of real-time data collection, expansion of application of other health indicators, and tuning the model to respond to different population segments in order to create an increasingly powerful prediction system. Perhaps one of the most prevalent reasons a baby is low birth weight is a condition known as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). This is when an infant fails to develop as he or she ought to when in the womb and could be the result of something wrong with the placenta or the mom or baby's health. Researchers discovered that there was a direct relationship between the mothers' health and the birth weight of babies. The best part is that we have valid reasons to think that we can significantly reduce the instances of LBW by having improved medical care during pregnancy. Early detection of issues will minimize risks of low birth weight, and we can think of ways to help. Our method strongly examines risk factors in pregnant women that are readily identifiable by simple means during pregnancy, enabling us to make more accurate predictions. The identification of low birth weight (LBW) events is a significant area of study in maternal and neonatal health, given that LBW has been correlated with higher risks of infant mortality, developmental complications, and total long-term health issues. Demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables are the conventional clinical signs used for identifying LBW risk, but these are not quite reliable because the determinants of LBW are multifaceted. Machine learning (ML) provides a possible solution in tapping enormous health data to find emergent patterns and relationships that are hard to detect for conventional statistical models. Using ML algorithms including decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and ensemble models, researchers can improve the accuracy of LBW predictions, which makes early intervention and prenatal care more efficient. Machine Learning models can learn from various sources of data such as maternal health records, socioeconomic status, nutritional levels, and genetics to create predictive models to help healthcare providers determine high-risk pregnancies. Supervised learning algorithms, with training on past datasets, can predict pregnancies based on the likelihood of LBW, and unsupervised learning methods can determine hidden risk factors. Besides, deep learning techniques, specifically neural networks, have shown high accuracy in predicting health outcomes through learning intricate non-linear associations between variables.
Low Birth Weight (LBW) describes babies born with weights under 2,500 grams (5.5 pounds).

The condition functions as a vital marker for infant health problems because it directly relates to infant death rates and future medical issues. Research indicates that a pregnant woman's health status strongly affects the weight she delivers. Healthcare professionals can improve maternal and newborn outcomes through early identification of high-risk pregnancies. A machine learning system can predict LBW cases by analyzing multiple health indicators of pregnant women. The proposed model uses various machine learning approaches to analyze maternal health data and identify LBW cases at an early stage. The problem requires supervised machine learning to perform binary classification between LBW cases and NOT-LBW cases. The web-based application uses all important parameters to calculate newborn weight accurately for practical implementation.
